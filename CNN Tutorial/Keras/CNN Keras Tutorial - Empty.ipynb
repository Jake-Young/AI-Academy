Overfitting happens when our model becomes to acustomed to the features of our training data and so performs worse when validating our performance. By augmenting our data we are generating a set amount of variations for each image that we pass into the `ImageDataGenerator()`. \n",

Y is set equal to the \"classes\" array as the classes array needs to be in an array of the same dimensions as X.\n",
