# Example Turtorial
This folder has been made as a guide to follow when creating your own tutorials for others. Please make sure you have the files
above before pushing you tutorial to the master branch. 

In the example notebooks there are formatting examples, please follow as close as possible when writing your tutorials and make
sure to keep an eye on this folder in case any of the formatting changes. 

The theory doc does have to be in pdf format if you are uploading a file. If you are working in an online document like Dropbox
paper or google docs for example, you at the very least need to have a link to the document so that it is accessible for those
going through the tutorial.
