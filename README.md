# AI Academy
This project has been started in AI Camp Belfast with the intention of providing a single source of clear and concise tutorials to help teach people the skills needed to get involved in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. 

**Everyone** is welcome to contribute to this project as we don't want to close this information off to people. If you wish to get involved and contribute to the collection please make sure you meet the requirements below before the finalised tutorial is merged with the main branch. 

## Tutorial Upload Requirements :
- An empty jupyter Notebook with a step by step walkthrough describing how to complete the tutorial
- A complete and commented jupyter notebook with the supporting step by step walkthrough
- A supporting theory document which breaks down the topic that the tutorial focuses on
- The data used which must be <100MB, if the data is larger you must provide a link to download the data used
- A requirements text file which lists the libraries that are needed to run and complete the tutorial 

If you are making use of a Kaggle kernel notebook, make sure that you download the notebook so you fulfill the above requirements and provide a link to the public kernel on kaggle in description of the tutorial. 

If you are not sure of any of the requirements refer to the example tutorial in the repository. 

## Tutorials In Progress : 
- Graphs and Visualising Data with Matplotlib/Seaborn
- CNNs and Image Processing with Keras, Tensorflow and PyTorch
- Numpy library breakdown
- Face Recognition with OpenCV
- Gender Recognition from Images
- Analysing Time Series Data
