# AI NI Academy
This repo has been created as an open place for any tutorials that our community posts, walkthroughs we create for AI NI Academy and an alternative space to talk about our upcoming events. 

**Everyone** is welcome to contribute to this project as we don't want to close this information off to people. If you wish to get involved and contribute to the collection please make sure you meet the requirements below before the finalised tutorial is merged with the main branch. 

# Our Next Event!

**AI NI Datathon - 26th/27th October**

We are hosting another hackathon this year after the success of our first earlier in the year and we can't wait to see everyone back working together on AI! The Datathon will be hosted, again, over two locations; _Queen's University, Belfast_ and _Ulster University, Magee_. 

The theme is **"AI for Good"**, this time we are putting a larger focus on education. These two days are a fantastic way for you to learn, develop new skills or find a new interest, and meet like minded people. I alsmost forgot to say **free food**!

If you are interested in going, head over [here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ai-ni-datathon-tickets-64800724712?aff=ebdssbdestsearch) to sign up.

We will be there to help out and support everyone taking part, we want everyone to learn as much as they can and have fun.
