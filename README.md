2 day hackathon brought to you by AI NI and Hackily! Kindly supported by our platinum partner Bazaarvoice and hosted by QUB! We’re inviting 200 AI enthusiasts from across the island and beyond to be part of the inaugural AI Initiative hackathon.

With the rapid advancement of AI technology, it is important to use its power in ways that benefit society. We’ll provide a welcoming and collaborative environment for you to build out brilliant, innovative, and impactful ideas using AI. You’ll meet fellow hackers, learn new technologies, and work alongside seasoned mentors.

We'll provide the food, swag, workshops, mentorship, prizes and more. Don't have a team, or even an idea? Don't worry! We'll give you the tools to build something incredible.

We'd love to see you here!
